            <p class="lead">What if you could have a meaningful, well-paid career without a daily commute to a physical office?</p> 

            <p>What if your team or organization could work well together even when physically apart?</p>

            <p>What if your organization's "work from home" policy could be a competitive advantage, while also helping address important social, diversity, urban planning and environmental issues?</p>

            <p>If you are working in, joining, or starting a distributed team, this book is for you. The short, easy-to-read chapters have practical takeaways on topics like:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Why distributed teams are good for business, diversity, employee retention, social and the environment.</li>
              <li>How to run efficient video calls and meetings while dealing with lots of email and group chat.</li>
              <li>How to handle complex interpersonal topics such as hiring, firing, one-on-ones, reviews, trust and group culture.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Drawn from 26+ years working in distributed organizations, the book gathers what did-and did not-work from my own hard-learned lessons, as well as learnings from company founders, hedge fund managers, software developers, data scientists, accountants, book publishers, economists, political organizers, recruiters, military personnel, executive assistants, therapists and medical technicians.</p>

            <p>John O'Duinn has written code and led teams in organizations ranging from four-person startups to nonprofits to multinationalsâ€”including the US Government as part of the Obama White House, for the US Digital Service.</p> 

            <p>As a computer guy, John is comfortable with high stress, high ambiguity projects and enjoys using his skills with large complex distributed systems to solve problems that make a measurable difference to real humans.</p>

            <p>In addition to technology, John loves growing a culture where diverse groups of humans work well together in a distributed global workplace. He has worked in distributed companies of one form or another for 27 years and led distributed teams for 14 years. The most extreme was a team he grew and led at Mozilla, with 18 people in 14 cities, in 4 non-adjacent timezones, working with Mozilla's globally distributed open source community. Over the last five years, he has consulted at large organizations in transition; mentored fast-growing distributed companies; and presented at universities, startup incubators, and conferences. He has lived and worked in 13 cities across four continents.</p>

            <p>John received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from Dublin City University, co-wrote a chapter of The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume 2, blogs on oduinn.com and is a steering committee member of IEEE RelEng. He has a Shodan black belt in Aikido, loves travel and is on track to fill his passport again.</p>
