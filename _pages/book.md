Can you have a meaningful, well-paid career without a daily commute to a physical office, and without burning out? Can your team or organization work well together and maintain team culture, even when physically apart?

Can your organization's "work from home" policy be a competitive advantage--improving organizational resilience while also addressing important social, diversity, urban planning and environmental issues?

If you find yourself asking questions like these, this book is for you.

This updated second edition features best practices from over 28 years working in, leading, and coaching globally distributed organizations--as well as lessons learned helping organizations quickly shift to fully distributed during COVID-19 office closures.

Each short easy-to-read chapter has practical takeaways on what did--and did not--work from my own hard-learned lessons, along with a wide range of interviews with company founders, hedge fund managers, government agency leaders, software developers, accountants, political organizers, recruiters, military personnel, executive assistants and medical technicians.
